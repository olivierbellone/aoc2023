# aoc2023

My solutions for Advent of Code 2023. Going with Ruby because I don't have the time or energy to learn a new language this year.

## Installation

Clone the repository.

## Usage

Invoke the binary with the day number as the first argument, and the input file as the second argument.

E.g. to compute the solutions for the first day's puzzles:
```sh
./bin/aoc2023 1 input/day1.txt
```
